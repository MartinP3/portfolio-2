## Description
This is the website for my second ever made portfolio, it's made with the Svelte framework and is using Vite as it's bundler</br>
In the portfolio I am sharing some information of myself, my path before I reached the one for web development</br>
There is also three of my later school projects where I made various applications, one for online auctions where the user can bid on items and list items for others to bid on, another for online shopping where a user can purhcase various products that were predetermined and finally a project where the user could book holidays and venue managers could list venues for others to book holidays.
